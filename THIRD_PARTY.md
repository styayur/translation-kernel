# Third-party materials

The application has no installed runtime dependencies and no bundled fonts, datasets, models or images. A tiny Vite-generated module-preload helper is included in UI builds under Vite's MIT license. Vite and its build dependencies retain their original copyright and licensing.

Development dependencies include TypeScript (Apache-2.0), Vite/Vitest (MIT), Playwright (Apache-2.0), ESLint (MIT), Prettier (MIT), jsdom (MIT), TypeScript ESLint (MIT), globals (MIT) and type definition packages (MIT). React (MIT) and Vue (MIT) are test fixtures only and are not included in the extension or SDK. Transitive dependencies remain governed by their individual package LICENSE files; the lockfile pins the resolved graph. [Dependency license inventory](docs/dependency-licenses.json) lists the resolved licenses; regenerate it with `pnpm licenses list --json` after dependency changes.

Provider integrations call external services and do not redistribute their engines or models. Google, OpenAI-compatible providers and Ollama instances apply their own service/model terms. No third-party service is affiliated with or endorsed by this project.
